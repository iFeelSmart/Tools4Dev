## Name
<p>gik</p>


## Synopsis
<p>Module used to manager several git projects through one command interface</p>


## Definition
<p>

Gik is a CommandLineTools utility that allow dev to use several Git projects as a unique project.
Moreover, it allows to quickly test low level lib modification on a highlevel project.
Gik want to increase flexiblity between projects

Gik stay close to git and use manifest.xml in order to clone and manage several git repositories.

When you use several projects at a time you will have to make some adjustement depending on your project.
There is 2 different behaviour that you need to have in mind:

* Custom Option
commit or push option for gik are quite different because you need ability to commit in several projects in one command.
Imagine that ou are fixing a bug in a high level application that need to changes file in a really low lvl libraries.
Gik will allow you to create a branch one both repositories and fix a bug as a global fix.
* Other
If you need to execute quick git command directly from a global workspace.
Gik will launch a different command depending on what you are saying to gik
- Known Options         -> Execute custom gik option command
- It's a file           -> Go to folder where file is then execute git command
- A folder              -> Go to folder then execute git command
- Something Else        -> Execute git command on all subrepositories defined in manifest.xml file
