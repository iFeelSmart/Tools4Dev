BitBucket API Command Line Tools

* Create a global PullRequest

Return green URL if PR was creating, Yellow if already exists

* Finish

Create Global PullRequest,
It will list all PR linked to your workspace then add their URL links to the description.
DON'T USE THIS COMMAND unless you really want QA to review your work.
__That means your work on any tickets is DONE__ .

* OSX

You can use your Keychain in order to store your password.
__vi $Tools4Dev_PATH/.${USER}.env__ add line __BITBUCKET_USERNAME={BitBucketUser}__ .
Go to your keychain then add a password with account named __BitBucketPassword__ .
Take care of removing all old BITBUCKET_USER_AND_PASSWORD reference in $WS_ROOT/.${USER}.env
Bb8 will now ask for your keychain password any time he wants to access your password.
