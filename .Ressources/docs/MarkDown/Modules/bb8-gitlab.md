Git management tool API Command Line Tools

* Pull Request vs Merge Request

Same Git management feature with different names.
This tool was created with PullRequest in mind so it will keep using that term in the documentation.

* Create a global PullRequest

Return green URL if PR was created, Yellow if already exists

* Finish

Create Global PullRequest,
It will list all PR linked to your workspace then add their URL links to the description.
DON'T USE THIS COMMAND unless you really want QA to review your work.
__That means your work on any tickets is DONE__ .

* OSX

You can use your Keychain in order to store your password.
__vi $Tools4Dev_PATH/.${USER}.env__ add line __BITBUCKET_USERNAME={BitBucketUser}__ .
Go to your keychain then add a password with account named __BitBucketPassword__ .
Take care of removing all old BITBUCKET_USER_AND_PASSWORD reference in $WS_ROOT/.${USER}.env
Bb8 will now ask for your keychain password any time he wants to access your password.
remember that such a security lvl will broke some silent functions that will need your
password to access keychain

* Token

Gitlab requires a Personal Access Token with 'api' scope to work.
__vi $Tools4Dev_PATH/.${USER}.env__ add line __GITLAB_TOKEN={GitlabToken}__ .
With recent bitbucket version you may replace bitbucket password by a token it will work as well

* BB8 Mode

Bb8 now support multiple remote config to be able to interact with both bitbucket and gitlab.
Please define T4D_BB8_MODE in your env to be able to use it correctly
